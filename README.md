# Getting Started

I use Atom with the plugin Markdown Writer to write posts.

To create a new draft, go to "Packages" -> "Markdown Writer" -> "File" -> "Add New Draft".

The draft will be stored in the `_drafts` folder.

After the draft is completed, with the file opened, go to "Packages" -> "Markdown Writer" -> "File" -> "Publish".

The draft will be moved to the `_posts` folder. Add the post and push it to github to publish it.
